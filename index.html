                <p>
                    Narcan (naloxone) is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies in Anaheim, including
                    CVS and Walgreens locations. You can also get it for free from the Orange County Health Care
                    Agency's office at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=1725+W.+17th+Street,+Santa+Ana,+CA" target="_blank">1725 W. 17th Street, Santa Ana</a>.
                    Other local sources include community health centers and harm reduction programs - the LGBT Center OC and APAIT Health Center
                    often provide free Narcan. To administer Narcan nasal spray: remove from the package, insert
                    nozzle into the nostril of the person experiencing overdose while they lay on their back, and
                    press firmly to spray the entire dose. It is recommended to carry two doses of Narcan together
                    at all times. If the first dose was not enough to stop the overdose, you will know within two
                    minutes of administering the Narcan. Watch for <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000949.htm" target="_blank">withdrawal symptoms after administration</a>. After
                    administering, call 911 immediately and stay with the person. California's Good Samaritan law
                    protects people who assist during overdose emergencies, meaning you won't face arrest for
                    small amounts of drugs when seeking medical help.

                <h3>Awareness</h3>
                /* information written by Charlie and Chloe */
                <p>Fentanyl is extremely potent, as little as 2 milligrams or about the size of a few grains of salt
                    can be lethal. Many street drugs now contain fentanyl, including counterfeit pills that look exactly
                    like prescription medications. Never use drugs alone, it is best to always have someone present
                    who can respond to emergencies or use virtual spotting services. Be aware that counterfeit pills
                    and other drugs may contain fentanyl without your knowledge. Signs of fentanyl overdose
                    include shallow or no breathing, unresponsiveness, and blue or gray skin tone, as well as
                    pinpoint pupils and gurgling sounds. If you choose to use substances, start with a very small
                    test amount and go slowly. Having an emergency plan and telling someone you trust about your
                    use can help save your life.

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                /* information written by Charlie and Chloe */
                <p>Fentanyl test strips can be ordered from <a href="https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-single-strip-free-shipping/" target="_blank">DanceSafe.org</a> and other harm reduction
                    organizations. In Orange County, they're available from several needle exchange programs and
                    community organizations, contact the OC Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) for locations
                    and hours. To use test strips: dissolve a small amount of the substance in water following the
                    specific ratios for different substances, dip the strip, and wait 5 minutes for results. However,
                    test strips aren't perfect and they may miss some analogs and won't detect all dangerous
                    substances. The safest approach is to only use substances obtained from legitimate medical
                    sources. If you choose to use, having test strips, never using alone, and keeping Narcan on
                    hand are essential safety practices. Always test each new batch, even from the same source.
